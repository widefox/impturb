##Impulse turbine power output calculator

##Design Notes for deletion when programme works: math direction...create relevant equations

##First Principles - Pressure = Force/Area
* 1 Pascal (pressure) = 1 Newton of force per square meter
* 1 Bar = 100,000 Pascals
* 1 metric horsepower = 75kg of force per square meter = 735.5 Watts
* Power (mechanical power in Watts) = torque (N.m) * angular speed (in radians per second); equivalently use RPM which is simpler...
** for end users - divide by 60 for RPM
* P = T*2π*(N/60)
* where P = mechanical power /W; T = torque /Nm, and N = revolutions per minute

##Requirements
Python 2 or 3

##List Constants
* Gravity (g) = 9.8125 m/s/s at latitude 52°17′59″ N longitude 1°31′59″ W
* Gravity coordinates in decimal form: 52.299722 latitude; 1.533056 longitude

* rho = circa 1000 kg/m3 for fresh water (rho = density of working fluid kg/m3) and 1200kg/m3 for seawater
* Pi (π) = 3.14159265358979323846264338
* g = gravity in Leamington Spa UK = 9.7803267714 * (1 + 0.00193185138639sin2λ/√1-0.00669437999013sin2λ)...
** ...where sin2 = sine squared; and where lambda (λ) = latitude. Note vis decimal latitude e.g., 52.3 for latitude 52° 18' 0")
* Allow users an automated (url) so they can calculate gravity for their actual locus using a latitude lambda value...
accurate to as many dec places as possible
 
#Issues
Based on inputting the jet force. More options such as water head should be given
